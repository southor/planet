__name_h__   correct way?   add name of project?
constants instead of defines
how to write number of ?
start with exceptions
Rename Client and Server to something else now that we
have namespaces that has taken their names.
Move Container typedefs out from WolrdModel class
set id as a member of T in IdMap instead of using Pair?
Use Obstacles as name instead of ObstacleContainer ??  Use the same sytem everywhere.
Fix template functions for sending messages via Link??
vector normalize, return a new vector instead of chagning?
In the real game: use macros for get/set functions?
begin to use different game objects (playerObj, projectile, etc..) for server and client?
in real game: use a macro to be able to switch between call by reference and call by value (because of standard C++ problems)
Could need log messages that is sent, for debugging.
Not put special includes in common.h? Only those who needs it?
Maybe use a template for keeping an object with it's history list and add necessary functions.
In Client.cpp, maybe timeHandler.reset() should not be called at START_GAME.
use less constants and use more static variabels that should be set to default variabels at start and then altered with configure files.
Really use default contructor that assign all members for value-types like vec2 ??
really do update only when we render?
